            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p class="p-abt">I’m <b>Laiba Sumaiya Nazim (Puspa)</b>, a BSc student in Information & Communication Engineering at Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP). I have a strong curiosity for technology and a passion for learning how code and networks can solve real-world problems.</p>
            <p class="p-abt">Through my studies, I’ve built a foundation in programming with C, C++, and Java, and I’ve explored front-end development, web design, and CSS. I enjoy taking ideas step by step, turning them into practical projects, and continuously improving my skills.</p>
            <p class="p-abt">I’m actively exploring both software development and networking to find where I can make the most impact. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects, grow as an engineer, and push the boundaries of what I can create.</p>
